CIxD Syntax
====================================

An experimental repository that acts as an online documentation for syntax that could be used in Conversational Interaction Design.


Syntax
-------------------------------------
When trying to translate a conversational design from words on a piece of paper to something actionable. I would imagine this to be even more important if using conversational design in a team setting. Here, it would be necessary for all members of the team to "speak" and understand the language fluently; hence a syntax guide might be helpful similar to those supplied for many programming languages.

In an attempt to keep "computer speak" at a minimum, I've given the UI the human name `Yui`. I have no idea if this is beneficial, but it feels much better than `Computer:` or `UI:`.
